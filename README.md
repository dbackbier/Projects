# Projects
Contains projects I've worked on, whether for an assignment or for personal enjoyment.

1. simulation.py: This is a fairly basic Python project that simulates NFL games on a basic level, taking into account the relative rankings of both teams' offense and defense. It could be improved upon in the future.
2. Baseball.py: This project was a final project for a game design class in high school. It was coded in Python, using the Pygame library. The premise of the game is simply a home run derby, where a batter gets 10 swings to get as many home runs as possible, one person plays as the pitcher, and one as the batter, and is run locally on one computer/ keyboard. An interesting feature of the game is that the pitcher is able to move the ball after pitching to try to trick the batter into swinging and missing.
3. learning.R & statsR.R: These files aren't really a project, but are my attempts at teaching myself R, purely for fun. They just contain code from a W3 Schools tutorial (I think that's where I got it from, at least).
